## TODO

Add New Features by adding new things to the Director

  - Add new Enemies to the Scenes
- Could change the number of lives, difficulty constants (damage, healthpoints) (read from a .txt file? or could make a constants.py)

### Project Demo (Saturday 7/16) *Voting Topic locked until 7/18
- A one minute recording showing off game and its mechanics

## Week 14 - Voting

### Final Video
Highlight the code you contributed to in the final project
- Introduce yourself
- Talk about what parts of the project you worked on
- Must be around 1 minute long
- Must have your face in the video
  - Recording with Zoom's share screen has worked well for me
