Overall design:

First figure out the Game Logic --> Classes and objects with Attributes and Methods
                    translate them into

Questions:
- Should we try animations?
- How complex should we make the game?
    - simply fight and defeat enemies
    - collecting coins/money?
    - levels/progression?

Type:
2D Platformer
- Player moves around to defeat enemies (vertical)

Dungeon Crawler
- Player moves around to defeat enemies (top-down view)

Jobs?
Ashley
- copy over the base project, sort into folders? (Actors - actor, Colliding_Actor, Fighting_Actor, Player, Enemy, enemy types)
    - Things that inherit from eachother in the same folder/section
- Look for images/sprites and how to incorapate them into pyray (see professor's Batter game)

(Things to consider when making Classes/Objects)
Object
- Has stuff (Attributes/Variables)
- Do stuff (Methods/Functions)
- Is a/Are stuff (Inheritance)

(W11 - Maintainability)
Maintainability:
- clear variable names
- clear documentation (Readme  or in a design text file explain how the class realte to eachother and what each class does)
    - README
    - Text file
    - And comments for each Class

-   -   -   -   -
Director/Main
- In charge of the entire game
- Creates a Cast of Actors
    - Cast in charge of updating the positon of each actor
    - Would be in charge of animating each Actor
        - Actors would have a list of sprites, then move to the next one in the list to animate it
- Creates a Collision Hanlder, gives it Cast's list of Colliding_Actors
    - Determines if there was a collision between Colliding_Actors
        - Then figures out how to handle it (Decrease HP, out of lives, game over)
        - Should Player/Enemies have weapons or just bounce into eachother?
        - Add knockback?

Actor
- position, color/sprite
- ability to move itself/update the position

Message/Text on screen (Actor)
- overrides to be a message

Colliding_Actor (Actor)
- Any Actor that can be collided with
- Have the functionalty to collide with other Colliding_Actors
- Has a hitbox, keeps track of if something hit the box

Fighting_Actor (Colliding_Actor)
- Could have a weapons
- Animate the weapon/decide how it moves (sweeping arc, or jab)
- Have a health bar to display current HP
- If HP --> 0, then do something

Collision Handler
- Called by Cast
- Checks if Colliding_Actors have collided, and handles what happens
    - If Player/Player weapon has hit an Enemy, then damage them
        (decrease the healthpoints)

Hitbox (something that a Colliding_Actor has)


Cast
- called by Director
- Hands the Colliding_Handler a list of Colliding_Actors, see if they collide

Player (Fighting_Actor)
- overrides movement by using Player Input
- overrider defeat method so if the Player is defeated
    - Game over
    - Or loses a life

Enemy (Fighting_Actor)
 - if hits Player, Player is damaged

Example
Wolf (Enemy)
- how it moves
- how it looks
